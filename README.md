This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

### Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies by running `yarn` inside the project folder

## Running the app

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

## ðŸ“‹ Coding Standards

### Components

The components are separated into five(5) categories to further organize the project.

**screens** - The final screens that users interact with

**templates** - Templates define the layout and structure of a specific screen or view. They assemble organisms and molecules into a cohesive user interface.

**organisms** - Organisms are groups of molecules and atoms that form a complete functional section of your application. For instance, a login form with input fields, a button, and error messages.

**molecules** - Molecules are composed of one or more atoms and represent more complex UI elements such as password input and search bar.

**atoms** - This folder contains the smallest and most basic building blocks of the application, such as buttons, inputs. Atoms should be highly reusable and not contain any business logic.

### Screens/Components structure

- Use hooks: for state and lifecycle
- Separate the complex/stateful logic into the 'MyComponent.container.tsx' file
- Define template with minimal logic in 'MyComponent.view.tsx' file
- Define the props in your 'MyComponent.props.ts' file
- Put all styling on 'MyComponent.style.ts' file using styled components
